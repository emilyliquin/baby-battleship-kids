Each branch is for a different study/population. Here is some information about the branches:
- kidpilot_v1: initial pilot to test method (similar to kidbaseline_v1, but more trials)
- kidbaseline_v1: study 1, used to understand what kinds of questions kids/adults asked in this task (kid version)
- adultbaseline_v1: study 1, used to understand what kinds of questions kids/adults asked in this task (adult version)
- kid_questionexposure_final: study 2 (main study in CogSci paper), used to investigate the effects of question exposure on later question asking (kid version)
- adult_questionexposure_final: study 2 (main study in CogSci paper), used to investigate the effects of question exposure on later question asking (adult version)
- kid-questionexposure-presentation: live demo of study 2, kid version
