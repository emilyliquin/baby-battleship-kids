            The purpose of this study was to understand how people ask questions. During childhood and beyond, we learn by asking questions. For example, we ask questions about everyday events (“Why did you park there?”), and we learn new things from the answers we receive.

            This study aims to understand how children and adults learn by asking questions. We present participants with different scenarios, and we observe what questions they ask about those scenarios. This will help us understand how different features of a scenario, such as how the scenario relates to previously encountered scenarios, impact question asking.
